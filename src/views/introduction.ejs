<h3>
What Is A Vector
</h3>
<p>
A <b>vector</b> is a mathematical object that has both magnitude (or length) and direction. 
Think of it like an arrow: the length of the arrow represents the magnitude, and where it points represents the direction.
<br>
Vectors can be represented in various ways, such as an arrow in a diagram, or more formally as an ordered list of numbers (e.g., [x,y] for a 2D vector, or [x,y,z] for a 3D vector). These numbers are called the components of the vector and tell us how far to move along each dimension.

<li>Displaying forces in physics (e.g., the push or pull on an object).</li>
<li>Representing coordinates or positions in space.</li>
<li>Displaying direction of movement or orientation.</li>
<li>Creating embeddings in machine learning, which are numerical representations of complex data like words or images.</li>
</ul>
<br>

A key concept about vectors is that they are not limited to a specific number of dimensions. While it's easy to visualize 2D or 3D vectors, they can exist in much higher dimensions, and the underlying mathematical operations remain consistent regardless of the number of dimensions.
<br>
In this workshop, we'll primarily explore examples using 2D vectors to make the concepts easy to visualize. However, the same mathematical principles and operations you learn here apply directly to higher-dimensional vectors, like the 392-dimensional vectors you'll encounter in the embedding model example later on.
